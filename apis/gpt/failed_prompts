"All right let's go my name is jason this channel is a chain of blocks and in this video i want to take a look at three undervalued altcoins that i think have massive potential to boom as we move into 2022.
Now the good thing about these altcoin projects is i haven't heard too many people talking about them so that's always good when you want to beat the rush and get in early.
So i want to show you what it is about these projects that i like, why i think they have so much potential, and some predictions for where the price might be heading in the near future.
Of course, i am not your financial advisor nothing in this video should be taken as financial advice just my own research guys sharing it with you.
This should be one step in your efforts to do your own research we will go over everything including how you can invest in these tokens guys but let's start right here:
current crypto market cap sitting at 2.55 trillion dollars, we have been moving up bitcoin establishing that level above 51 000 guys, if we look at some of the top 10 here solana push its way above 200 again it's slightly below right now even cardano ada has moved its way up look dot now over 32 guys.
So things are starting to re rebound rally a little bit after the consolidation some of the shakeout some of the selling off from some weaker hands so hopefully your diamond hand stays strong and you can now work your way up i think we are set to push back up as we move into the new year guys.
But look if we look over here we've looked at this indicator a lot lately this is the bitcoin two-year moving average with the 5x multiplier on top of it so this red line here look it's very very simple when you look at this chart if you've bought below the green line if you've ever bought bitcoin below the green line you're you're above you're up right now and when we see this chart as well the red line tends to be the end of bull markets guys
So when we've gone above this red line the 5x on the two-year multiplier look that hasn't been a good sign but as you see here we've come very very close a couple of times and now we're sitting right here in the middle with a lot of room to move up as we move into the new year
So look we're going to look at three coins right now i want to show you why i like these projects why i'm selecting these let's start here with the first one and number one on the list it's called anchor
Guys and this one's a pretty simple play for me this is called better savings and this is running on tara luna so it's really easy right we've seen enormous incredible exuberance from tara luna; parabolic growth over the past 12 months.
So what do you want to do you want to go find the applications the d-apps the projects that are launching on tara luna and anchor is one of those projects so if you look over here you can come right now to their app and they have over 10 billion dollars locked up here so you can see this right here; total value locked on this protocol this is very very cool you can come here connect your wallet and you can start participating in d5 on tara luna.
So the reason i put this in here and you can come over here guys this is a site that i like to use a lot of course anything i talk about mentioned today will be in the descriptions box below so look go use these resources that's what they're here for guys defy llama this is a place you can come and you can look at a bunch of defy stats
So right now what we are looking at i'll pull up their menu here we're looking at all the chains all the blockchains, here we are looking at the total value locked on these blockchains 
So as you would imagine ethereum is number one i wouldn't think that tara would be number two i would think binance smart chain but terra like i said parabolic growth over the past months is now in that number two spot so if you click into this a little further what are the projects like how does it have so much total value locked and you see here anchor is the number one d app on tara luna and it's really not even that close by over two billion dollars and this hasn't even updated this probably needs to update again probably does a 24-hour update because you can see here they are not quite up to date on the total value locked as far as ust u.s tara on this decentralized application so look when you see a project like this number one on the hottest blockchain by far in the entire ecosystem and then when you look over here at the price 3.86 and you see that it only has a 726 million dollar market cap so this could easily 10x and put itself at about 7.2 billion dollar market cap and that would be totally fine that wouldn't be out of the norm for a highly valuable protocol on one of the hottest blockchains that we have so that probably puts it in the top 30 top 20 position but that's definitely very doable so that puts this at about a 35 coin in my opinion so look even if you just look at the all-time high for the cryptocurrency eight dollars and 23 cents and you see the total value locked is pushing up and up and up so let's just these are projects that you want to look for they have an enormous value locked on the chain on their application but the market captures doesn't re reflect that so this is number one on my list and if we look over here let's take a look at where you can get anchor right now bring up these trading pairs this is currently available on teraswap if you want to go the decentralized exchange also okay x bitfinix kucoin gate io available widely guys this is a pretty big project currently ranked in the top 150 of cryptocurrencies so look do your own research but check out anchor running on tara luna arguably the most valuable decentralized application on the entire luna ecosystem so let me know what you guys think let's go over here guys number two it's called marinade and look like i do all the time i go to these blockchains whether it's solana whether it's tara whether it's avalanche whatever is hot whatever people are using and buying those tokens and then you go and find the applications that are the hottest on there so look we've talked about you know find the dexes right we've talked about trader joe's on avalanche we've talked about phantom and radium and all these things on solana and now marinade is a way for you to stake your solana earn those staking rewards over six and a half percent but not have to lock up your soul to do so so you see here no lock up but you still compound the rewards and you can participate in defy on the solana blockchain so i think that's really cool if you look at their application you can come over to it working it's available it's usable right now you can connect your wallet i have phantom i use the phantom wallet on solana but you can connect any solana wallet here and participate so if you have soul in your wallet what they do is you can trade it here and you can stake it and what they're going to do is they're going to give you this m sole so marinade soul is i think what that is but m sole is a way you can still come over here and you can come to the d5 and you can stake your msol you can earn you can borrow you can lend you can do all of these things all the while you're still earning the 6.67 apy for staking your solana you're still participating in securing the ecosystem securing the blockchain and it's a win-win for everybody so i think this is very cool if we look over here guys marinade mnde is the token currently trading at 27 cents guys but this is small and this is only a market cap right now of 15 million but look if you look over here this is just we'll come back here on the defy llama to the chains let's look on solana right because just go to the solana chain that's number four on total value lock so where's all the where's all the value on solana let's look at the list radium's number one okay that makes sense number one decentralized exchange on solana what's number two number two is marinade guys so look it's up 17 over the past seven days 1.6 billion locked up on this and it's a way for you to help secure and stake your solana while earning multiplied rewards so i really think that's very very cool if you look over here this one is trading we'll bring up the trading pairs right here obviously it is trading on radium it's also trading on orca the other decks as well so look this is very powerful very very new project if you look over here currently ranked 1082 by market cap guys so look let me know what you guys think about marinade on the solana blockchain guys let's finish up we're doing three i said we're doing three number three on the list actually you can't go get this token everywhere not available on exchanges you will have to go through their public sale which is still they're still in the pre-sale of this but providence blockchain guys this is a new blockchain that's launching and i want to tell you exactly what it is about this that has me so excited but you see here open source ecosystem for developing and deploying blockchain based d5 so look we have that right but this is garnering some big attention especially from this company right here which is called figure.com and if you look here figure offers a simpler faster way to find loans that are right for you so look this company this figure is created by if you look over here mike cagney and the only reason i'm bringing this up is because he's had a little bit of success right mike cagney is the founder creator of sofi and sofi is traditional finance he is now transitioning over to decentralized finance with this project guys and if you look here figure unveils first solution for private companies to raise manage and trade equity so look all private companies that want to come here participate in blockchain they're going to use this figure.com this is going to be big for real estate a lot of real estate projects are going to launch on here as well guys so a lot of things are going to launch on here using this provenance blockchain and the providence blockchain has a token and this token is called hash and there are many hashes if you go to coingecko or market cap but this one actually has not launched it the only way you can actually get this right now is going through what figure is one of the websites you can go through so you can come over here and you can sign up with figure and by doing so you basically create a wallet when you do this you do have to go through an amount of kyc where they will ask you to send a picture of your driver's license they will give you a little bit of the hash token in your wallet they give you you actually have to go through the kyc twice i don't know if it's a bug but it gives you 10 tokens per time you do go through there and then if you come over here once you pass the kyc you can deposit usd now you're not deposit this is not through an exchange right now you would have to send a bank wire to they give you a bank account to send it to it does take a few days depending on your bank once that happens you would have an available amount of usd in here you could then come back to their trading page and trade so look it's a little bit of a complicated process this token is currently going for about 11 and a half cents i think this has some potential to be good however if you do look at this right now with the token going for about 11 and a half cents and the token supply this does put this at about 11 billion market cap which puts us as a very large project as a blockchain that hasn't launched it so i think it's pretty exciting with what they have going on but definitely do your own research no guarantees in crypto no guarantees in anything guys that's it for this list guys let me know what your best holdings are for 2022 and if you want to know more low cap all coins that i think have huge potential check out this video right here until the next time be safe
